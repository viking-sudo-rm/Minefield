	This is a little game that the SnorriDev team made for a computer course. Its a bit 'laggy,'
since it uses an HTTP server rather than a custom one. However, its still very fun and cool.

	Credz to symentax4797 and legotack as well.

	Each client connects to a server. On a server, you spawn in the middle of a map. All the players on
a server are little tank things. They can drop mines to blow other tanks up. WASD keys move the
tanks. There is very little friction, meaning that tanks slip and slide once they start moving. In
addition, tanks can push other tanks into landmines.

	Run a server. Then connect to it with multiple clients entering the server's IP address into the
login form in each client.
